# Weather Application - NodeJS , AWS and Docker
In this project, I created a basic application using NodeJS.


 **NodeJS Application** 

The NodeJs Application is the basic use of API from OpenWeather.
We can add a city to get its weather.

**AWS Part**


We created an IAM role in AWS.


Then log in with an AWS IAM account.

Now create an EC2 instance.

Now connect to the EC2 instance using SSH.

Now install the node and clone the project from GitHub.

To download NodeJS follow this link:- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04

Now run your NodeJS file (server.js).

Now in the AWS instance, click on your running instance, then change the inbound security.

Now copy the public IP address: "PORT NUMBER" and press enter.


YAY!!! DONE NodeJS application is now hosted on AWS.

**Docker Hub URL**
